# USA-States-Autocomplete-App
#### This project is part of the challenge I'm doing currently which is the #30Days30Projects challenge, and this is Day 8.
This app takes in an input, searches a JSON file and  returns all states that matches it using Fetch API and async Await to handle Promises, Higher order functions (filter &amp; map) and Regex. The UI is made with Bootsrap 5 Cyborg theme....
The user gets an alert if they input a letter that no state name or state abbreviation starts with.
I learned a lot, I haven't worked with higher functions much, and I have never worked with Regular Expressions before so this was a great opportunity for me to research them.
